## Introduction

User flow diagrams are a useful tool to map out what users when navigating through a digital service. GOV.UK services use a common set of page patterns, so a small set of common page types can be used to map out a wide variety of service journeys. 

This repository provides a set of high-res icons for use when mapping out GOV.UK user flows.

If you use Sketch, you might prefer [govuk-design-system-flow-diagrams](https://github.com/dashouse/govuk-design-system-flow-diagrams) or [gov-flow](https://github.com/charlesrt/gov-flow)
